<p>Mushroom and buffalo mozzarella savory pie is a really tasty dish with a rich and intense aroma that is quick and easy to prepare in advance. Perfect at any time of year and on any occasion, this is a great recipe to enjoy at lunch, dinner or during an aperitif with friends, as an alternative to pizza and also perfect for a lunch out celebrating Easter or Easter Monday.<br />Its rustic flavor and delicious aroma will win you over at the first taste, especially when accompanied by a cold beer!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
<li>200 gr of 00 flour</li>
<li>100 gr chopped butter</li>
<li>50 ml cold water</li>
<li>a pinch of salt</li>
<li>700 gr mixed mushrooms (I used prataioli and cardoncello)</li>
<li>1/2 glass of white wine</li>
<li>2 tablespoons of olive oil</li>
<li>one clove of garlic</li>
<li>parsley</li>
<li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
<li>one buffalo mozzarella</li>
<li>1 egg</li>
<li>100 ml fresh cream</li>
<li>40 g grated parmesan cheese</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Start the preparation from the brisee dough: Place the flour in a well on the work surface or in a bowl or in the blender. Cut the well-cold refrigerated butter into pieces and add it to the flour, working it quickly with your hands so that it crumbles; add the cold water and pinch of salt, a little at a time, always kneading with your other hand.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="936" height="897" class="wp-image-8711" src="https://cookingwithtina.github.io/cookingwithtina//wp-content/uploads/2022/03/photo5906931478275668341.jpg" alt="" /></figure>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Continue kneading with your hands until you get a smooth, well-blended dough; form into a round loaf and refrigerate 30 minutes wrapped in plastic wrap.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="784" height="646" class="wp-image-8712" src="https://cookingwithtina.github.io/cookingwithtina//wp-content/uploads/2022/03/photo5906931478275668339.jpg" alt="" /></figure>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Prepare the mushrooms: remove any remaining soil with a small brush or cloth, then slice all the mushrooms. Heat the two tablespoons of oil in a pan with the garlic clove cut in half; add the mushrooms and cook over high heat for 5 minutes, deglazing with the wine. Lower the heat, season with salt and pepper and continue cooking for 20 minutes over medium heat. At the end of cooking, remove the garlic, season with parsley, if necessary let the cooking liquid dry for 5/6 minutes on high heat without a lid, then let cool.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="1020" height="954" class="wp-image-8713" src="https://cookingwithtina.github.io/cookingwithtina//wp-content/uploads/2022/03/photo5906931478275668337.jpg" alt="" /></figure>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>With a whisk, mix the egg with the cream and grated cheese in a bowl. Add the mushroom mixture and stir to combine.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="921" height="894" class="wp-image-8714" src="https://cookingwithtina.github.io/cookingwithtina//wp-content/uploads/2022/03/photo5906931478275668336.jpg" alt="" /></figure>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Roll out the brisee dough on a sheet of baking paper greased with oil, using a rolling pin, obtaining a sheet about 3 mm. thick; place it with its baking paper inside a 22-cm-diameter mold, prick the base with the tines of a fork and pour the prepared mixture inside.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="1193" height="951" class="wp-image-8715" src="https://cookingwithtina.github.io/cookingwithtina//wp-content/uploads/2022/03/photo5906931478275668338.jpg" alt="" /></figure>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Add the lightly squeezed sliced buffalo mozzarella and bake in a static oven preheated to 180° for 40 minutes. When finished baking, unmold the savory pie and let it cool before bringing it to the table.</p>

<p>Poke bowl is a complete, Hawaiian-derived one-pot meal with an exotic, oriental flavor that is fresh, light, healthy and colorful; it is usually served as an appetizer or main course, but it is also perfect as a one-pot meal since it contains just the right amount of protein, carbohydrates and good fats. It is a quick and very easy preparation, perfect for all occasions! Like any traditional recipe there are several versions: at the base there is always rice (basmati, brown, black), for the protein part you can also use fresh downed salmon or tuna (or smoked salmon, crabmeat for those who do not like raw), for the fruits and vegetables you can add pineapple or radishes, tomatoes and steamed zucchini&#8230;the secret is to color as much as possible!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The term Poke or Pokè in Hawaiian really means &#8220;cut up&#8221;; this dish has ancient origins: in 400 AD, fishermen in the Pacific Ocean prepared it as a snack, simply with leftover fresh fish.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Serves for two:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
<li>160 g Basmati Rice</li>
<li>200 ml water</li>
<li>250 gr chicken breast</li>
<li>20 gr teriyaki sauce (or soy sauce)</li>
<li>garlic powder to taste</li>
<li>a teaspoon of lemon juice</li>
<li>salt to taste</li>
<li>100 gr edamame (soy beans)</li>
<li>1 avocado</li>
<li>1/2 mango</li>
<li>1 leaf of Nori or Wakame seaweed</li>
<li>1 generous tablespoon of sesame seeds</li>
<li>1 tablespoon of rice vinegar</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>First divide the chicken into strips, drizzle them with the Teriyaki sauce, lemon juice and garlic powder and let them marinate for at least half an hour in the refrigerator.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="1131" height="678" class="wp-image-8510" src="https://cookingwithtina.github.io/cookingwithtina//wp-content/uploads/2022/01/photo6007832350391646267.jpg" alt="" /></figure>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Prepare the rice: rinse it under running water to remove all the starch; you will need to do this 4-5 times until the water is clear. Then drain the rice from the water and let it sit for 15 minutes. Place the rice in a pot and add the cold water, cover with a lid and bring the water to a boil.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="855" height="804" class="wp-image-8511" src="https://cookingwithtina.github.io/cookingwithtina//wp-content/uploads/2022/01/photo6007832350391646268.jpg" alt="" /></figure>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>As soon as it starts to boil, lower the heat and cook over low heat, still with the lid on, for about 10 to 12 minutes so that the rice absorbs all the water. Once ready, remove the pot from the heat and let it sit for another 10 minutes, still with the lid on.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p id="step1">Heat the rice vinegar with 2 to 3 pinches of salt and pour it into the rice then strain with a wooden spoon to separate the grains. Keep aside to cool.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="1065" height="960" class="wp-image-8512" src="https://cookingwithtina.github.io/cookingwithtina//wp-content/uploads/2022/01/photo6007832350391646264.jpg" alt="" /></figure>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Blanch the edamame pods (you can find them in stores or ethnic departments) for 5 minutes, let them cool and shell them</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Cook the chicken with its marinade for 7 to 8 minutes until dry, then let it cool; in the meantime, slice the avocado into cubes, so also the mango; cut the nori seaweed into pieces as well.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="939" height="855" class="wp-image-8513" src="https://cookingwithtina.github.io/cookingwithtina//wp-content/uploads/2022/01/photo6007832350391646263.jpg" alt="" /></figure>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>When all the ingredients are ready, take two bowls, add the rice, sesame seeds and all the ingredients, creating islands of color in the dish!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Chicken, vegetable and cashew couscous is a typical North African dish that is simple, quick, fresh and light, made with durum wheat semolina and, in my version, flavored chicken, vegetables and dried fruits. It can be eaten hot or cold and is perfect as an appetizer, served in elegant single portions, for a light dinner among friends. This unique dish, very tasty, is also suitable for those who are watching their figure, ideal for those who want to take a quick meal to the office, perfect for a picnic in the &#8216;outdoors! If you like this recipe also try <a href="https://cookingwithtina.github.io/cookingwithtina//cous-cous-di-verdure/">my vegetarian version!</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
<li>200 gr of precooked couscous</li>
<li>220 gr of water for the couscous</li>
<li>60 gr extra virgin olive oil (about 3 tablespoons)</li>
<li>450 gr of chicken breast</li>
<li>two tablespoons of soy sauce</li>
<li>one teaspoon of garlic powder</li>
<li>100 gr toasted, unsalted cashews</li>
<li>juice of half a lemon</li>
<li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
<li>two carrots</li>
<li>two zucchini</li>
<li>one spring onion</li>
<li>one sachet of saffron</li>
<li>curry and turmeric to taste.</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Start the preparation from the chicken: dice the breast and put it in a bowl with a tablespoon of oil, soy sauce, lemon juice, garlic powder, salt and pepper to taste; cover with foil and let it flavor in the refrigerator for at least a couple of hours.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="714" height="687" class="wp-image-7869" src="https://cookingwithtina.github.io/cookingwithtina//wp-content/uploads/2021/05/photo5798749223548728651.jpg" alt="" /></figure>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>After the time has passed, in a large frying pan, best wok type, pour the chicken, let it cook stirring often for about 5-7 minutes, until it has made a nice golden crust. Once ready, set the chicken aside</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="798" height="674" class="wp-image-7870" src="https://cookingwithtina.github.io/cookingwithtina//wp-content/uploads/2021/05/photo5798749223548728646.jpg" alt="" /></figure>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the same pan with the chicken stock, heat a tablespoon of oil, pour in the chopped spring onion, then also add the chopped carrots, add a couple of tablespoons of water and stew for 5 minutes. Add the zucchini, again chopped, season with a teaspoon of turmeric and curry to taste, put the lid on and cook the vegetables over medium heat for 10 minutes, then remove the lid and let dry another 5 minutes. Finally, add the cashews.</p>

</li>
</ul>
</figure>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the meantime, prepare the couscous: pour it into a large bowl and add a tablespoon of oil, separately boil 220 g of water with a sachet of saffron and a teaspoon of salt, then turn off the heat and pour the broth over the couscous; cover with plastic wrap and let the couscous swell: this will take about 5 minutes. Shell the ready couscous with a fork.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

</li>
</ul>
</figure>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Once the vegetables are ready and have cooled, pour them into the bowl, add the chicken, which is also cold, and mix everything together. Your cold chicken couscous is ready to serve, with a few basil leaves!</p>

<p>Shrimp curry is a tasty, flavorful dish with ethnic aromas and flavors that becomes a perfect one-pot meal when accompanied with basmati rice or rice pilaf. The shrimp, lightly seared, are soft and juicy and are served with a fragrant creamy sauce that is just spicy enough. This rich and colorful dish is perfect for an oriental-style dinner, allowing you to bring a twist to the table without sacrificing simplicity.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ingredients for two people</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
<li>250 g of Shrimp to be cleaned</li>
<li>45 gr Curry Paste (I found the brand &#8220;Golden Curry at Esselunga, in the ethnic section!)</li>
<li>1 teaspoon turmeric powder</li>
<li>2 tablespoons Seed Oil</li>
<li>1 teaspoon cornstarch</li>
<li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
<li>parsley to taste</li>
<li>350 g water</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="684" height="957" class="wp-image-7583" src="https://cookingwithtina.github.io/cookingwithtina//wp-content/uploads/2021/03/photo5938406720902640850.jpg" alt="" /></figure>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Start by cleaning the shrimp, removing the carapace (keep it aside) and the black intestinal filament; put the rinsed shrimp in a bowl, add a tablespoon of seed oil, a teaspoon of turmeric, salt and pepper and mix well, then cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let them season in the refrigerator for at least an hour, preferably overnight.</p>

</li>
</ul>
</figure>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Prepare the fumet: in a saucepan put the heads and shells of the shrimp and toast them for a minute, add the &#8216;water, cover with a lid and let it cook for at least 45 minutes. When the shellfish stew is ready, strain it through a fine-mesh strainer and set aside.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Place the strained stew in a saucepan, add the curry paste, parsley and a teaspoon of cornstarch, stir with a whisk and cook until thick and lump-free (about 15 minutes).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the meantime, take out the shrimp that you had left to marinate in the refrigerator, heat a tablespoon of seed oil, add the shrimp and let them cook for about 5 to 6 minutes.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="882" height="828" class="wp-image-7578" src="https://cookingwithtina.github.io/cookingwithtina//wp-content/uploads/2021/03/photo5938406720902640855.jpg" alt="" /></figure>

<p>The Scented Chicken Skewers with Basmati Rice is a truly original meat main course with ethnic flavors and very tasty. Perfect for an evening with friends, this simple but impressive recipe has a sweet and delicate aroma, and is ideal for those who love ethnic flavors and want to eat light!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
<li>400 g chicken breast</li>
<li>zest and juice of one orange</li>
<li>zest and juice of one lemon</li>
<li>2 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil</li>
<li>grated ginger to taste</li>
<li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
<li>150 g white yogurt</li>
<li>6 basil leaves</li>
<li>a handful of mint leaves</li>
<li>250 gr of basmati rice</li>
<li>30 gr pine nuts for decoration</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Dice the chicken, grate the zest from the orange and lemon and make the juice.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Prepare a marinade with the juice and zest of the citrus fruits, oil, grated ginger, salt and pepper and soak the chicken pieces in it for at least two hours, covered with foil, in the refrigerator.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="876" height="843" class="wp-image-7382" src="https://cookingwithtina.github.io/cookingwithtina//wp-content/uploads/2021/01/photo5814151229675255242.jpg" alt="" /></figure>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thread the drained chicken into wooden skewers, take a large nonstick griddle or skillet, heat it thoroughly and then place the chicken skewers on top of it. Do not cook on too high heat, turn the chicken skewers on all surfaces for about 10 minutes</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

</li>
</ul>
</figure>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the meantime, cook the Basmati rice: first place it inside a colander and rinse it with cold running water, then drain it and place it in a pot, covered with two fingers of water; season with salt and cook for about 10 minutes, until the water is completely absorbed. Alternatively, you can cook the rice in plenty of salted water, then drain it</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Blend the marinade liquid with the basil, mint and yogurt until creamy.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="837" height="819" class="wp-image-7387" src="https://cookingwithtina.github.io/cookingwithtina//wp-content/uploads/2021/01/photo5814151229675255241.jpg" alt="" /></figure>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>It&#8217;s time to serve: spread the rice on a serving plate, sprinkle some of the yogurt sauce, place the hot skewers on top and finish with more sauce; top with pine nuts and serve immediately.</p>

<p>Beans with sausage is a rustic, tasty, simple and inexpensive recipe that is also ideal as a main course. This intensely flavored dish is perfect on cold days, excellent served with croutons of bread with which to make the inevitable scarpetta, and a drizzle of raw oil that enhances the flavor. To make it, you can use borlotti, cannellini, red, black, azuki, and eye beans; if you use dried ones, soak them the night before. Prepare this dish for the whole family, and maybe enjoy it in front of the TV, during the screening of the famous Wild West-style movie &#8220;They Called It Trinity,&#8221; just where the legendary Bud Spencer and Terence Hill enjoyed this recipe!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
<li>200 g of fresh sausage</li>
<li>200 g fresh or dried beans</li>
<li>1 onion</li>
<li>1 clove of garlic (or a teaspoon of garlic powder)</li>
<li>2 tablespoons of evo oil</li>
<li>half a glass of white wine</li>
<li>2 tablespoons of tomato paste</li>
<li>350 g of vegetable stock</li>
<li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
<li>chopped rosemary to taste</li>
<li>a few drops of tabasco</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you use dried beans, soak them for 12 hours. Then pour them into a saucepan with cold water, bring to a boil and cook for about an hour. When ready, drain the beans and save some of the cooking water</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Sauté the chopped onion and garlic clove in a large skillet with &#8216;oil; add the sausage broken up with your hands and let it brown over high heat for a few minutes. Deglaze with white wine and, as soon as the cooking liquid has evaporated, add the beans, tomato paste, salt, pepper, tabasco and rosemary</p>

<figure class="wp-container-18 wp-block-gallery-17 wp-block-gallery columns-1 is-cropped"><ul class="blocks-gallery-grid"><li class="blocks-gallery-item"><figure><img loading="lazy" width="791" height="720" src="https://cookingwithtina.github.io/cookingwithtina//wp-content/uploads/2020/05/photo5947555078552531784.jpg" alt="" data-id="4720" data-link="https://cookingwithtina.github.io/cookingwithtina//?attachment_id=4720#main" class="wp-image-4720"/></figure></li><li class="blocks-gallery-item"><figure><img loading="lazy" width="777" height="717" src="https://cookingwithtina.github.io/cookingwithtina//wp-content/uploads/2020/05/photo5947555078552531785.jpg" alt="" data-id="4721" data-full-url="https://cookingwithtina.github.io/cookingwithtina//wp-content/uploads/2020/05/photo5947555078552531785.jpg" data-link="https://cookingwithtina.github.io/cookingwithtina//?attachment_id=4721#main" class="wp-image-4721"/></figure></li></ul></figure>



<p>Sigillate con pellicola trasparente e attendete 5 minuti: trascorso questo sgranate il cous cous con una forchetta e lasciate intiepidire. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="822" height="720" src="https://cookingwithtina.github.io/cookingwithtina//wp-content/uploads/2020/05/photo5947555078552531787.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-4722"/></figure>



<p>In una padella antiaderente fate tostare gli anacardi per 6/7 minuti a fuoco medio, poi tritateli grossolanamente con un mixer o con un coltello e trasferiteli in una ciotolina.</p>



<figure class="wp-container-20 wp-block-gallery-19 wp-block-gallery columns-1 is-cropped"><ul class="blocks-gallery-grid"><li class="blocks-gallery-item"><figure><img loading="lazy" width="1280" height="720" src="https://cookingwithtina.github.io/cookingwithtina//wp-content/uploads/2020/05/photo5947555078552531780.jpg" alt="" data-id="4723" class="wp-image-4723"/></figure></li><li class="blocks-gallery-item"><figure><img loading="lazy" width="1280" height="720" src="https://cookingwithtina.github.io/cookingwithtina//wp-content/uploads/2020/05/photo5947030495541965409.jpg" alt="" data-id="4735" data-full-url="https://cookingwithtina.github.io/cookingwithtina//wp-content/uploads/2020/05/photo5947030495541965409.jpg" data-link="https://cookingwithtina.github.io/cookingwithtina//cous-cous-di-verdure/photo5947030495541965409/#main" class="wp-image-4735"/></figure></li></ul></figure>



<p>Nella stessa padella preparate le verdure: scaldate i 2 cucchiai di olio rimanenti, aggiungete il porro tritato e lasciate imbiondire a fuoco dolce. Aggiungete le carote tagliate a dadini, saltatele a fuoco vivace per farle dorate bene per 5 minuti. </p>

<p>Unite poi le zucchine tagliate sempre a dadini, abbassate la fiamma, inserite 2 cucchiai di acqua e fate cuocere per altri 6 minuti con il coperchio. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1280" height="720" src="https://cookingwithtina.github.io/cookingwithtina//wp-content/uploads/2020/05/photo5947555078552531783.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-4726"/></figure>



<p>Infine aggiungete i pomodorini tagliati a pezzetti, aggiungete sale, pepe, la curcuma, le foglie di basilico e proseguite la cottura altri 5 minuti. </p>



<p>Spegnete il fuoco e lasciate completamente raffreddare.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="937" height="692" src="https://cookingwithtina.github.io/cookingwithtina//wp-content/uploads/2020/05/photo5947555078552531786-1.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-4729"/></figure>



<p>Unite quindi le verdure al cous cous, mescolate bene il tutto, poi trasferite su un piatto da portata.</p>

<p>Servite il vostro cous cous di verdure con gli anacardi tostati e foglioline di menta come decorazione.</p>
