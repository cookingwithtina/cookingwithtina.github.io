										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Cantonese Rice is the best-known recipe in Chinese cuisine, along with <a href="https://cookingwithtina.github.io/cookingwithtina//ravioli-cinesi-al-vapore/">steamed dumplings, </a> spring rolls, and chicken with almonds! This recipe is based on basmati rice first boiled (best the day before!) and then stir-fried in a pan or Wok with scrambled eggs, peas, ham and gaberetti! A simple, quick, tasty and colorful dish, the whole family likes it and the kids love it! Prepare Cantonese rice and serve it with the famous chopsticks, just Chinese style! Ingredients for two/three people:</p>
<ul>
<li>1 tablespoon Chinese wine</li>
<li>1 tablespoon oyster sauce</li>
<li>2 tablespoons of soy sauce</li>
<li>2 tablespoons seed oil</li>
<li>2 spring onions</li>
<li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
<li>200 g basmati or Jasmine rice</li>
<li>2 eggs</li>
<li>150 g frozen peas</li>
<li>150 gr fresh or frozen shrimps</li>
<li>150 gr diced cooked ham</li>
<li>salt to taste.</li>
</ul>
<p>To prepare Cantonese rice, first rinse the rice under running water several times until the water is clear (this is a crucial step!), then let it drain on the colander. Cook the rice in plenty of lightly salted water (don&#8217;t overdo it because then the soy sauce will take care of it!) for 6 to 7 minutes and drain when al dente. Let the rice cool completely for about 20 to 30 minutes inside a large baking dish-it will reach the right consistency. <img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8815" src="https://cookingwithtina.github.io/cookingwithtina//wp-content/uploads/2022/05/photo5782690774620683312.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="834" /></p>
<blockquote><p>Ideally, cook the rice the day before and leave it in the refrigerator overnight-this step ensures the perfect texture of Cantonese rice once sautéed!</p></blockquote>
<p>Mix the Chinese wine, oyster sauce, and soy sauce in a small bowl and set aside (you can find all these ingredients in ethnic stores!) <img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8816" src="https://cookingwithtina.github.io/cookingwithtina//wp-content/uploads/2022/05/photo5782690774620683313.jpg" alt="" width="960" height="1143" /> Boil the frozen peas for about 8 minutes, then drain and set aside; do the same thing with the shrimp for 5 minutes, if you got them frozen. <img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8817" src="https://cookingwithtina.github.io/cookingwithtina//wp-content/uploads/2022/05/photo5782690774620683315.jpg" alt="" width="866" height="960" /> In a nonstick skillet or wok, heat 1 tablespoon of seed oil, add the lightly beaten eggs with a pinch of salt, place over medium heat and stir with a whisk a few minutes, then set aside. In the same clean skillet with a sheet of paper towels heat 1 tablespoon of seed oil, add the thinly sliced spring onions and garlic powder, heat 1 minute, then add the cooked peas and shrimp and saute a few minutes.</p>

<p>Add the scrambled eggs, cold rice, and add the sauces, stir to coat the rice and cook over high heat for 2-3 minutes until the liquid evaporates, then turn off the heat. Finally add the cooked ham and let it mix for a few more seconds (the ham should not cook!). Add another tablespoon of oyster or soy sauce if desired! <img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8820" src="https://cookingwithtina.github.io/cookingwithtina//wp-content/uploads/2022/05/photo5782690774620683319.jpg" alt="" width="1140" height="945" /> Here&#8217;s your <strong>Cantonese Rice </strong>ready, colorful and flavorful, serve it with the appropriate chopsticks, just Chinese style! <img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-8821" src="https://cookingwithtina.github.io/cookingwithtina//wp-content/uploads/2022/05/photo5782690774620683316.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="960" /></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Fortune cookies are crunchy treats, of Japanese origin, very simple and original: they are crescent-shaped cookies, flavored with vanilla, made with egg whites, sugar, oil, flour and vanillin, inside of which is enclosed a message, usually prophetic or even divinatory phrases, but it can also be personalized! Their preparation is very simple, but care must be taken not to overcook them, or undercook them, and once they are baked, when quickly the leaflet should be inserted and the cookie folded and set aside to cool. Try making homemade fortune cookies to surprise friends at the end of a special evening, or personalize them to make a truly original Valentine&#8217;s Day gift!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ingredients for about 14 cookies:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
<li>75 g egg whites</li>
<li>110 gr of sugar</li>
<li>90 gr of 00 flour</li>
<li>20 gr of cornstarch</li>
<li>15 gr melted butter or extra virgin olive oil</li>
<li>one sachet vanillin</li>
<li>2 tablespoons of water</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>To prepare the fortune cookies recipe, before you start write the messages that will go inside the cookies, cutting out small strips of light paper; I wrote phrases to dedicate to my husband, for Valentine&#8217;s Day!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>First prepare the dough: pour the egg whites and sugar into a bowl and beat with a whisk to combine them, but without whipping them to stiff peaks. Add the melted butter or oil, vanillin, 00 flour and sifted cornstarch.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="1044" height="927" class="wp-image-8582" src="https://cookingwithtina.github.io/cookingwithtina//wp-content/uploads/2022/02/photo5785005826417735899.jpg" alt="" /></figure>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mix well, again with a kitchen whisk, then add a couple of tablespoons of water until you have a creamy mixture, a rather thick batter.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="963" height="960" class="wp-image-8583" src="https://cookingwithtina.github.io/cookingwithtina//wp-content/uploads/2022/02/photo5785005826417735898.jpg" alt="" /></figure>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Cover a baking sheet with baking paper and draw circles using a glass about 7/8 cm in diameter, spacing them slightly apart.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Take a generous teaspoon of the mixture, place it in the center of a circle on the baking paper and with the back of the teaspoon expand it in circular motions until the circle is filled. You will need to get a thin layer. Since fortune cookies should be closed and folded while they are still warm, bake them three/four at a time so you have plenty of time to proceed with the folding.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1208" height="891" class="wp-image-8584" src="https://cookingwithtina.github.io/cookingwithtina//wp-content/uploads/2022/02/photo5785005826417735902.jpg" alt="" /></figure>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Bake and bake for 7 to 8 minutes in a static oven preheated to 175°; do not bake them longer or they will be too hard and you will not be able to fold them and they will all break (as happened to me, lucky I had more dough!!)</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="1246" height="868" class="wp-image-8585" src="https://cookingwithtina.github.io/cookingwithtina//wp-content/uploads/2022/02/photo5785005826417735901.jpg" alt="" /></figure>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Once they are baked, turn them upside down so that the side in contact with the plate becomes the inside of the cookie, lay a small card in the center of each with your favorite message, close it in a crescent shape and fold the two tips down (gently and being careful not to break them).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Use the rim of a glass or with the rim of a cup to give the cookies their characteristic shape by folding them over and bringing the ends closer together</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<figure class="wp-container-2 wp-block-gallery-1 wp-block-gallery columns-2 is-cropped">
<ul class="blocks-gallery-grid">
<li class="blocks-gallery-item">

</li>
</ul>
</figure>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Place the cookies thus formed inside a muffin mold and let them cool so that they keep their shape. Once cooled, your fortune cookies are ready to be enjoyed, and how satisfying!</p>

<p>Poke bowl is a complete, Hawaiian-derived one-pot meal with an exotic, oriental flavor that is fresh, light, healthy and colorful; it is usually served as an appetizer or main course, but it is also perfect as a one-pot meal since it contains just the right amount of protein, carbohydrates and good fats. It is a quick and very easy preparation, perfect for all occasions! Like any traditional recipe there are several versions: at the base there is always rice (basmati, brown, black), for the protein part you can also use fresh downed salmon or tuna (or smoked salmon, crabmeat for those who do not like raw), for the fruits and vegetables you can add pineapple or radishes, tomatoes and steamed zucchini&#8230;the secret is to color as much as possible!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The term Poke or Pokè in Hawaiian really means &#8220;cut up&#8221;; this dish has ancient origins: in 400 AD, fishermen in the Pacific Ocean prepared it as a snack, simply with leftover fresh fish.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Serves for two:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
<li>160 g Basmati Rice</li>
<li>200 ml water</li>
<li>250 gr chicken breast</li>
<li>20 gr teriyaki sauce (or soy sauce)</li>
<li>garlic powder to taste</li>
<li>a teaspoon of lemon juice</li>
<li>salt to taste</li>
<li>100 gr edamame (soy beans)</li>
<li>1 avocado</li>
<li>1/2 mango</li>
<li>1 leaf of Nori or Wakame seaweed</li>
<li>1 generous tablespoon of sesame seeds</li>
<li>1 tablespoon of rice vinegar</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>First divide the chicken into strips, drizzle them with the Teriyaki sauce, lemon juice and garlic powder and let them marinate for at least half an hour in the refrigerator.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="1131" height="678" class="wp-image-8510" src="https://cookingwithtina.github.io/cookingwithtina//wp-content/uploads/2022/01/photo6007832350391646267.jpg" alt="" /></figure>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Prepare the rice: rinse it under running water to remove all the starch; you will need to do this 4-5 times until the water is clear. Then drain the rice from the water and let it sit for 15 minutes. Place the rice in a pot and add the cold water, cover with a lid and bring the water to a boil.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="855" height="804" class="wp-image-8511" src="https://cookingwithtina.github.io/cookingwithtina//wp-content/uploads/2022/01/photo6007832350391646268.jpg" alt="" /></figure>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>As soon as it starts to boil, lower the heat and cook over low heat, still with the lid on, for about 10 to 12 minutes so that the rice absorbs all the water. Once ready, remove the pot from the heat and let it sit for another 10 minutes, still with the lid on.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p id="step1">Heat the rice vinegar with 2 to 3 pinches of salt and pour it into the rice then strain with a wooden spoon to separate the grains. Keep aside to cool.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="1065" height="960" class="wp-image-8512" src="https://cookingwithtina.github.io/cookingwithtina//wp-content/uploads/2022/01/photo6007832350391646264.jpg" alt="" /></figure>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Blanch the edamame pods (you can find them in stores or ethnic departments) for 5 minutes, let them cool and shell them</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Cook the chicken with its marinade for 7 to 8 minutes until dry, then let it cool; in the meantime, slice the avocado into cubes, so also the mango; cut the nori seaweed into pieces as well.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="939" height="855" class="wp-image-8513" src="https://cookingwithtina.github.io/cookingwithtina//wp-content/uploads/2022/01/photo6007832350391646263.jpg" alt="" /></figure>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>When all the ingredients are ready, take two bowls, add the rice, sesame seeds and all the ingredients, creating islands of color in the dish!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Speck dumplings are dumplings made of bread (preferably the kaiser bun, popular in South Tyrol, but stale bread will do!) kneaded together with milk, onion, eggs and diced speck. This rustic, autumnal and really tasty first course is typical of Trentino-Alto Adige, and can be served in <a href="https://cookingwithtina.github.io/cookingwithtina//brodo-di-carne/">meat broth</a> or, as in this recipe, with melted butter and pepper. As an alternative to speck, you can add smoked lucanica, or cheese such as fontina and parmesan cheese, mushrooms, spinach! Pair this first course with <a href="https://cookingwithtina.github.io/cookingwithtina//zuppa-di-gulasch/">goulash</a> for a typical Trentino dinner!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
<li>250 g stale bread (white rosette-type bread with the crust) cut into cubes</li>
<li>150 g South Tyrolean Speck with its fat part, diced</li>
<li>2 eggs</li>
<li>200 ml milk</li>
<li>1 onion, finely chopped</li>
<li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
<li>2 tablespoons chopped parsley</li>
<li>1 tablespoon chopped chives</li>
<li>1 tablespoon flour</li>
<li>salt and pepper</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Begin preparation by finely chopping the onion; in a skillet, melt the butter over low heat, then add the chopped onion and diced speck.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Sauté for 5 minutes, stirring, then turn off the heat and keep aside.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Cut the stale bread into cubes and pour it into a bowl along with the milk, also add the eggs, chopped chives and parsley. Continue by adding the now-warmed speck and onion, the tablespoon of flour and start stirring to mix everything together (if the mixture turns out too dry, add more milk; if it turns out too sticky or soft, you can add very little more flour to the mixture).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Once ready moisten your hands slightly with cold water and form the dumplings by rolling the dough between your hands, they should be about 2 inches in diameter; place them on a tray with breadcrumbs as you form them.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Once ready you can cook them in boiling meat broth or salted water for 15 minutes of cooking time. You can serve them in broth or drained with melted butter on top.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Doses for 33 cookies:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
<li>125 g butter</li>
<li>70 g white sugar</li>
<li>70 g brown sugar</li>
<li>1 egg</li>
<li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract or a sachet of vanillin</li>
<li>25 gr of bitter cocoa</li>
<li>225 gr of 00 flour</li>
<li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
<li>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</li>
<li>1/2 teaspoon baking powder for cakes</li>
<li>100 gr milk chocolate chips (or chopped)</li>
<li>100 gr white chocolate chips (or chopped)</li>
<li>100 g dark chocolate chips (or chopped)</li>
<li>M&amp;M&#8217;s or chocolate chips for decoration</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In a large bowl, mix the chopped butter at room temperature together with the two sugars for a few minutes, using an electric beater</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="1011" height="939" class="wp-image-8183" src="https://cookingwithtina.github.io/cookingwithtina//wp-content/uploads/2021/09/photo5879988538542503098.jpg" alt="" /></figure>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Add the egg, vanillin or &#8216;extract while continuing to mix; add the bitter cocoa, flour, baking soda, baking powder and salt and mix with your hands until smooth.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Finally add the three types of chopped chocolate or chips, mix again. Place the dough in the refrigerator to firm up for 30 minutes.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Form balls of 25 g each with your hands, crush them slightly and place them spaced out on top of a baking sheet covered with parchment paper. Add a few M&amp;M&#8217;s or if you prefer chocolate chips on top as decoration and bake in a static oven, preheated to 170° for 12 to 13 minutes.</p>

</li>
</ul>
</figure>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Remove the cookies from the oven and let them rest for a few minutes before touching them, as they are very brittle at this stage. When they have hardened, move them to a wire rack to cool completely before serving.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
<li>4 eggs</li>
<li>60 ml whole milk</li>
<li>salt to taste</li>
<li>a drizzle of oil for cooking</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>To prepare the omelets first, break the eggs into a bowl, add the milk and a pinch of salt. Beat the eggs using a whisk until completely mixed with the milk.</p>

<p>Heat a pan (20 cm in diameter if you are making two, or larger for a single one) on the stove and add a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil, then turn the pan to distribute it over the entire surface; pour the egg mixture inside and cook the omelet over a slow flame: as soon as it starts to congeal on the edges (after one minute) cover with a lid.</p>

<p>Beef Stroganoff is a creamy, flavorful main course that originated in Russian cuisine: it consists of beef cut into strips and cooked with onion, tomato puree, all of which is tinged with vodka and flavored with<em> smetana cream</em> (or sour cream) and mustard. This hearty and nutritious dish is easy to make and very satisfying; make it if you want to impress your diners!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>There are two versions about the origin of this particular recipe, which is roughly in the mid-19th century: according to some, the dish was first prepared by a French chef in the service of Russian Count Pavel Stroganoff who, in order to make beef fricassee more palatable to his master, added a sauce made from sour cream; according to the other version, on the other hand, the recipe would take its name from the doctor who cured Tsarina Maria of food poisoning caused by herring with a diet of beef, onions and sour cream.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
<li>800 gr Beef Meat (tenderloin, sirloin, pink or walnut)</li>
<li>500 gr white onions</li>

<li>q.b. Fine salt and black pepper</li>

<li>one tablespoon of mustard</li>
<li>80 gr <em>smetana sauce</em> *</li>

<p>* For the smetana sauce (which you can substitute with sour cream):</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
<li>250 ml fresh cream</li>
<li>40 gr of mascarpone cheese</li>
<li>juice of half a lemon</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>To prepare beef stroganoff, start by preparing the smetana sauce: just whip the cream, add the mascarpone and the juice of the lemons, then letting it sit for about two hours. You can skip this preparation and use 80 g of sour cream.</p>
