<p>Mushroom and buffalo mozzarella savory pie is a really tasty dish with a rich and intense aroma that is quick and easy to prepare in advance. Perfect at any time of year and on any occasion, this is a great recipe to enjoy at lunch, dinner or during an aperitif with friends, as an alternative to pizza and also perfect for a lunch out celebrating Easter or Easter Monday.<br />Its rustic flavor and delicious aroma will win you over at the first taste, especially when accompanied by a cold beer!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
<li>200 gr of 00 flour</li>
<li>100 gr chopped butter</li>
<li>50 ml cold water</li>
<li>a pinch of salt</li>
<li>700 gr mixed mushrooms (I used prataioli and cardoncello)</li>
<li>1/2 glass of white wine</li>
<li>2 tablespoons of olive oil</li>
<li>one clove of garlic</li>
<li>parsley</li>
<li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
<li>one buffalo mozzarella</li>
<li>1 egg</li>
<li>100 ml fresh cream</li>
<li>40 g grated parmesan cheese</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Start the preparation from the brisee dough: Place the flour in a well on the work surface or in a bowl or in the blender. Cut the well-cold refrigerated butter into pieces and add it to the flour, working it quickly with your hands so that it crumbles; add the cold water and pinch of salt, a little at a time, always kneading with your other hand.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="936" height="897" class="wp-image-8711" src="https://cookingwithtina.github.io//wp-content/uploads/2022/03/photo5906931478275668341.jpg" alt="" /></figure>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Continue kneading with your hands until you get a smooth, well-blended dough; form into a round loaf and refrigerate 30 minutes wrapped in plastic wrap.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="784" height="646" class="wp-image-8712" src="https://cookingwithtina.github.io//wp-content/uploads/2022/03/photo5906931478275668339.jpg" alt="" /></figure>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Prepare the mushrooms: remove any remaining soil with a small brush or cloth, then slice all the mushrooms. Heat the two tablespoons of oil in a pan with the garlic clove cut in half; add the mushrooms and cook over high heat for 5 minutes, deglazing with the wine. Lower the heat, season with salt and pepper and continue cooking for 20 minutes over medium heat. At the end of cooking, remove the garlic, season with parsley, if necessary let the cooking liquid dry for 5/6 minutes on high heat without a lid, then let cool.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="1020" height="954" class="wp-image-8713" src="https://cookingwithtina.github.io//wp-content/uploads/2022/03/photo5906931478275668337.jpg" alt="" /></figure>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>With a whisk, mix the egg with the cream and grated cheese in a bowl. Add the mushroom mixture and stir to combine.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="921" height="894" class="wp-image-8714" src="https://cookingwithtina.github.io//wp-content/uploads/2022/03/photo5906931478275668336.jpg" alt="" /></figure>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Roll out the brisee dough on a sheet of baking paper greased with oil, using a rolling pin, obtaining a sheet about 3 mm. thick; place it with its baking paper inside a 22-cm-diameter mold, prick the base with the tines of a fork and pour the prepared mixture inside.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="1193" height="951" class="wp-image-8715" src="https://cookingwithtina.github.io//wp-content/uploads/2022/03/photo5906931478275668338.jpg" alt="" /></figure>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Add the lightly squeezed sliced buffalo mozzarella and bake in a static oven preheated to 180° for 40 minutes. When finished baking, unmold the savory pie and let it cool before bringing it to the table.</p>

<p>Pandoro is the typical December holiday dessert, a symbol of Christmas along with <a href="https://cookingwithtina.github.io//panettone/">Panettone</a>! Pandoro is the classic Christmas cake originating from Verona: it is a leavened dough made of flour, eggs, butter, sugar, and flavorings, which requires a little patience and about three days of preparation, but it is definitely worth it! With a soft texture and golden surface, fragrant, delicious, perfect to sweeten you during the Christmas holidays!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The origins of Pandoro are ancient and date back to the 1500s; when the &#8220;<em>pan de oro</em>&#8221; was served on the tables of wealthy Venetians. But it was Domenico Melegatti, founder of the confectionery company of the same name, who filed the official patent for the modern recipe of this soft dessert in 1892!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>A few tips:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
<li>All ingredients used, especially butter and eggs, should be at room temperature and not cold from the refrigerator.</li>
<li>Use Manitoba flour, which, due to the presence of a lot of gluten will ensure optimal alveolation for this cake.</li>
<li>Use an electric mixer or a planetary mixer or the Bimby, at the lowest speed and do not be in a hurry when making it, give the planetary mixer the right amount of time to work everything and the dough to rise. Nothing prohibits you from using your hands to knead, but at least for 10 minutes!</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>TOTAL ingredients for a 1 kg mold</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
<li>450 g of Manitoba-type strong flour (with W of 350 0 460)</li>
<li>5 gr dry brewer&#8217;s yeast</li>
<li>70 gr of water</li>
<li>3 whole eggs</li>
<li>1 yolk</li>
<li>200 gr soft butter (30 gr for the 1st dough + 140 gr for the puffing* + 30 gr melted butter)</li>
<li>135 gr sugar</li>
<li>8 gr fine salt</li>
<li>grated peel of one orange</li>
<li>grated peel of one lemon</li>
<li>2 tbsp honey</li>
<li>2 tablespoons vanilla extract (or the seeds of 1 berry)</li>
<li>1 generous tablespoon of rum</li>
<li>powdered sugar to taste.</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Start the night before by preparing the flavor mix: pour the honey, grated lemon zest, grated orange zest, vanilla and rum into a bowl; mix, cover with foil and store at room temperature until used. Take 30 g butter and eggs out of the refrigerator and leave at room temperature.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="1083" height="789" class="wp-image-8385" src="https://cookingwithtina.github.io//wp-content/uploads/2021/12/photo5931540532780184636.jpg" alt="" /></figure>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>9 a.</strong> m. Next day, preparation of Biga:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
<li>50 gr flour</li>
<li>60 gr of water</li>
<li>3 gr dry yeast</li>
<li>10 gr sugar</li>
<li>1 yolk</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In a bowl pour the flour, water, yeast, sugar and egg yolk and mix everything with a spoon until a soft dough is obtained; cover with plastic wrap and let rise until it doubles in size and forms many small bubbles on the surface (about <strong>1 1/2 hours</strong>).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="852" height="825" class="wp-image-8386" src="https://cookingwithtina.github.io//wp-content/uploads/2021/12/photo5931540532780184634.jpg" alt="" /></figure>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>10:30</strong> a.m. Preparation of the First Dough:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
<li>the well-fermented pre-dough</li>
<li>200 g flour</li>
<li>2 gr dry yeast</li>
<li>10 gr water</li>
<li>25 gr of sugar</li>
<li>30 gr softened butter</li>
<li>1 whole egg at room temperature</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Pour the biga into the bowl of a planetary mixer or the Bimby, add the flour and sugar, also add the yeast and the room temperature egg. Operate the planetary mixer and let it work for about 10 minutes until the dough is smooth and well strung together. Finally, gradually add the soft butter in small pieces, kneading at medium speed (with the Bimby &#8220;spike&#8221; mode) until it is fully absorbed.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Transfer the dough to a flat surface, give it a couple of folds and a spherical shape, then transfer it to a large, tall bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and let <strong>rise for 2 to 3 hours</strong> at room temperature, or in the oven turned off with the light on-the dough should double in size</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<li>200 gr flour</li>
<li>100 gr sugar</li>
<li>aroma mix</li>
<li>2 eggs at room temperature</li>
<li>8 gr salt</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Pour the previous risen dough into the planetary mixer or Bimby, add in the flour, sugar and aromatic mix and knead a few seconds; add the eggs one at a time, always kneading at medium speed. Finally add the salt; continue kneading the dough until it has a soft consistency that pulls away from the sides.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Turn out onto work surface, give firm folds, place dough inside a large bowl lightly buttered and covered with foil and let rise inside oven with light on for about 2 h, almost doubling in volume.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>At this point knead quickly, then place the dough <strong>in the refrigerator to ripen 20 h</strong>.</p>

<p>Focaccia tramezzino is a really good, soft and tasty savory flatbread, perfect for your summer dinners with friends, for standing dinners or buffets and to take to the beach! This stuffed focacciona is really simple and quick to prepare, you can prepare and stuff it the day before, store it in the fridge, it tastes even better. Let&#8217;s see together the version with and without the Bimby. I made two flatbreads, one filled with mayonnaise, tomatoes, salad and ham; the &#8216;other with olive pate, scamorza cheese and sliced speck!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ul id="ingredients-0">
<li>½ teaspoon sugar</li>
<li>½ cube of fresh brewer&#8217;s yeast (12 g)</li>
<li>500 g milk (or 250 g milk and 250 g water) + q.b.</li>
<li>500 g of type 0 strong flour</li>
<li>2 level teaspoons of salt (10 g) + q.b. coarse salt for the surface</li>
<li>oil to taste</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>For the fillings</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ul id="ingredients-1">
<li>mayonnaise</li>
<li>100 g tomatoes, sliced</li>
<li>4 to 6 lettuce leaves</li>
<li>cooked ham</li>
<li>or: olive pate</li>
<li>scamorza cheese</li>
<li>sliced speck</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Recipe with the Bimby</strong>: place milk, oil, sugar and yeast in the mug 1 min at 40° vel 3; add 0 flour and fine salt 3 min at vel spiga.</p>

</li>
</ul>
</figure>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Recipe without the Bimby: </strong>dissolve the yeast in the milk or in the mixture of lukewarm milk and water, also adding the sugar. In a bowl put flour and salt. Add liquids in which you dissolved the yeast and work with a flat whisk, or even simply with a spoon, until the mixture is smooth and well hydrated.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Pour the dough (which will be very moist) directly into a rectangular or round 28-cm-diameter baking dish covered with baking paper or well oiled; cover with foil and leave for an hour until doubled in volume.</p>

<p>Easter Dove (in  italian &#8220;Colomba Pasquale&#8221;) is a leavened, wholesome, fluffy and fragrant cake, typical of Italian tradition, which is brought to the table or given as a gift on Easter Day, as a symbol of peace and love. I wanted to enrich the Colomba with raisins soaked in whiskey, but you can opt for classic candied fruit or chocolate chips. This is a simple though laborious preparation, very fluffy, with a soft and fragrant crumb, delicious from the first bite; follow the recipe step by step and you will bring to the table a dessert worthy of the best bakeries, leaving all your relatives and friends speechless!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>The origin of this cake is linked to many legends, one of which is placed in the first half of the 6th century: during the siege of Pavia by King Alboin, he was offered a dove-shaped cake by an old merchant as a sign of peace</p>
<p>Another legend dates back to the 1930s, when Dino Villani &#8211; advertising manager for a major confectionery company in Milan &#8211; repurposed the recipe for panettone to make a cake suitable for Easter, which took the shape of the dove, the symbol of peace.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ingredients for 2 Colombe (using two 500 g molds) or one 1 kg mold:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
<li>500 gr Manitoba flour</li>
<li>120 gr of sugar</li>
<li>80 ml whole milk</li>
<li>3 eggs</li>
<li>180 gr of soft butter at room temperature</li>
<li>15 gr fresh brewer&#8217;s yeast (4 gr dry brewer&#8217;s yeast)</li>
<li>10 gr salt</li>
<li>grated peel of 2 oranges</li>
<li>grated peel of 1 lemon</li>
<li>100 gr raisins</li>
<li>50 g whiskey or rum</li>
<li>2 sachets of vanillin, or a vial or vanilla seeds</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>For the icing:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
<li>50 gr almonds + 2/3 tbsp for decoration</li>
<li>50 gr of hazelnuts</li>
<li>20 gr cornstarch or potato starch</li>
<li>20 gr of polenta flour</li>
<li>100 gr of sugar</li>
<li>80 gr of egg whites</li>
<li>granulated sugar</li>
<li>powdered sugar to taste.</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Start preparing the Colomba two days before serving it! The night before, soak the raisins in a bowl with whiskey and 20 ml water.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="819" height="801" class="wp-image-7729" src="https://cookingwithtina.github.io//wp-content/uploads/2021/04/photo5999107008365704634.jpg" alt="" /></figure>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The next morning place the Manitoba flour, yeast dissolved in milk and sugar in a planetary mixer, Bimby or large bowl if kneading by hand, and knead for 2 to 3 minutes. Add the citrus peels and vanilla and knead another 3 minutes; add the eggs one at a time: only when the first egg is fully absorbed add the second and finally the third. Knead at least 15 minutes for this operation.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

</li>
</ul>
</figure>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>At this point add the very soft butter in small pieces, slowly: only when the first pieces are well absorbed then you can add the others; also for this operation knead at least 15 minutes.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>With the last bits of butter, add the salt; finally add the well-wrung raisins, knead for another minute, then take out the dough, and with hands greased with butter, form a ball</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Transfer the dough to a large bowl, seal with plastic wrap and <strong>let rise for at least 5 to 6 hours</strong> (the dough should triple in size) in the turned-off oven.</p>

</li>
</ul>
</figure>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>After the rising time has elapsed, invert the dough onto a work surface, roll it out with your fingertips, spreading it out from the edges, give the folds in the shape of a wallet :join the two ends in the center, then the upper flap toward the lower one, just as when making bread</p>

<p>Give the dough a spherical shape and transfer it inside a large glass bowl, cover with plastic wrap and let rise at room temperature for <strong>an hour</strong>, then transfer to the refrigerator, for <strong>at least 12 hours</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Once this last stage is finished, leave at room temperature for at <strong>least 2 hours</strong>, then transfer the dough to a lightly floured work surface and divide it into two equal parts (I chose to make two 500 g doves, if you make one use all the dough for a 1 kg mold).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Divide the two doughs in turn, one part, the body part, about 200 gr, and the wing part about 300 gr (150 gr each). Take the part for the body and spread it out on the surface with your hands and form a loaf, which you will place directly into the mold. In the same way form the two wings, placing them on either side of the body.</p>

<p>Panfocaccia, or Potato Focaccia, is a soft, fragrant and wholesome leavened flatbread made with sourdough, flour and boiled potatoes inside the &#8216;dough, excellent to eat instead of bread, but ideal, also to be stuffed with cold cuts, vegetables or cheese and served as an appetizer or snack on various occasions, such as buffets or aperitifs. This tall, soft focaccia, very easy to prepare and much more digestible thanks to the sourdough starter, will really please everyone, including children!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
<li>400 g of flour (I used Aida flour, stone-ground semintegral type 1 wheat flour, alternatively I recommend a Manitoba flour, or half 0 flour and half durum wheat semolina)</li>
<li>150 g of <em>refreshed</em> sourdough *</li>
<li>150 ml lukewarm water</li>
<li>200 g medium potatoes</li>
<li>9 gr salt</li>
<li>1 teaspoon of malt or honey</li>
<li>25 gr extra virgin olive oil + another 3 tablespoons</li>
<li>coarse salt to taste</li>
<li>chopped rosemary</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>* Start preparing the focaccia with sourdough the day before, in the early afternoon: remove the sourdough starter from the refrigerator and wait half an hour for it to reach room temperature. <em>Refresh the s</em> ourdough starter using the same proportion of flour and half the amount of water. Wait <strong>5 to 6 hours</strong> before proceeding to prepare the dough.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Cook the potatoes in plenty of salted water for at least half an hour, then peel and mash them, collecting the mash in a bowl and letting them cool completely.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the bowl of a planetary mixer, Bimby or a large bowl if kneading by hand, pour the flour, sourdough starter and malt, potatoes and start kneading. Then pour in the salt dissolved in &#8216;warm water and 25 g oil and knead at least 5 minutes; then form a ball and transfer the dough to a bowl greased with a tablespoon of oil.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Cover with plastic wrap and let the dough rest for 30 minutes in the oven off, with the light on; then fold the dough: with a spatula (the mixture is quite liquid) mix from the outside to the center. Repeat the &#8216;operation after another 30 minutes of resting the dough.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="894" height="867" class="wp-image-7361" src="https://cookingwithtina.github.io//wp-content/uploads/2021/01/photo5805478062912025871.jpg" alt="" /></figure>

<p>Cover again with plastic wrap and let rise again in the oven, with the light on for an hour, then transfer to the refrigerator overnight.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The next day take the dough out of the refrigerator and let it stand at room temperature for an hour, then grease a rectangular aluminum baking pan and spread the dough evenly over the entire surface; make small holes with light finger pressure. Let rise again for two hours, still in the oven off with the light on.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Season the potato focaccia with two tablespoons of oil, coarse salt to taste and the rosemary, distributing them evenly; bake the focaccia in a static oven preheated to 220° for 25 to 30 minutes, checking that the base is cooked before removing the focaccia.</p>

<p>Focaccia with sourdough is a rustic, fluffy, light and fragrant recipe with a long, slow rise, perfect as a bread substitute and ideal for bringing a natural and easily digestible product to the table. Excellent on its own or stuffed, it can be chosen as an afternoon snack, as an appetizer accompanied by sliced meats, cold cuts and favorite cheeses, grilled vegetables or with some salad, or as an alternative to Saturday night pizza; in any case you will bring to the table a tasty and delicious recipe that is difficult to give up!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
<li>500 g of flour (I used Aida flour, stone-ground semintegral type 1 wheat flour, alternatively I recommend a Manitoba flour, or half 0 flour and half durum wheat semolina)</li>
<li>100 g of <em>refreshed</em> sourdough starter *</li>
<li>370 ml lukewarm water</li>
<li>10 g salt</li>
<li>1 teaspoon malt or honey</li>
<li>6 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil</li>
<li>coarse salt to taste</li>
<li>mixed seeds (flax, sesame, pumpkin) or rosemary for decoration</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>* Start preparing the focaccia with sourdough the day before, in the early afternoon: remove the sourdough starter from the refrigerator and wait half an hour for it to reach room temperature. <em>Refresh the s</em> ourdough starter using the same proportion of flour and half the amount of water.

</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In a large bowl or planetary mixer, place the refreshed sourdough starter with 100 g of lukewarm water taken from the total dose and start kneading; add the flour, malt, salt dissolved in the rest of the water (270 ml) and two tablespoons of oil, knead well for at least 7 to 8 minutes until the mixture is very smooth, free of lumps and rather liquid.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="772" height="762" class="wp-image-7322" src="https://cookingwithtina.github.io//wp-content/uploads/2021/01/photo5794182092765116812.jpg" alt="" /></figure>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Transfer the dough to a bowl greased with a tablespoon of oil, cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let it rest for <strong>30 minutes</strong>; with a spatula (the mixture is very hydrated) make the folds: mix the dough from the outside towards the center, then let it rest again for <strong>30 minutes</strong>, and repeat the operation: this will serve to obtain a well-waved focaccia!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Cover the dough again with plastic wrap, and <em>let the dough activate the rising process</em> in a turned-off oven with the light on for an <strong>hour and a half</strong>, then transfer to the fridge <strong>overnight</strong>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The next day take it out of the refrigerator and let it sit at room temperature for <strong>an hour</strong>, then place the dough on a 28-cm-diameter cake mold covered with parchment paper and greased with a tablespoon of oil; spread the dough gently with your fingers, spreading it out until it covers the whole cake pan, again gently so as not to pull it apart.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Let rise for <strong>another hour and a half</strong> in the mold, always in the oven off. Drizzle the remaining two tablespoons of oil over the entire surface of the focaccia, poke holes with your fingers, salt to taste (without exaggeration) and add the mixed seeds (or some chopped rosemary).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Bake at 220° C in a preheated static oven for about 25 minutes. Once cooked, let cool and serve your focaccia, fragrant on the outside and very soft on the inside!</p>

<p>Baguette with sourdough is a fragrant, light and easily digestible bread with an elongated shape, typical of French gastronomic culture but known and appreciated all over the world. Crisp and crumbly on the outside and soft and delicate on the inside, this bread is perfect when paired with any dish: from butter and jam for breakfast, to cold cuts and cheese for a healthy, wholesome snack.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ingredients for two large baguettes:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Pre-dough:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
<li>150 gr 0 or Manitoba flour</li>
<li>150 gr of water</li>
<li>40 ge of sourdough starter</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Dough:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
<li>all pre-dough</li>
<li>300 gr 0 or Manitoba flour</li>
<li>140 gr of water</li>
<li>60 gr of sourdough starter</li>
<li>1 teaspoon malt powder (or sugar or honey)</li>
<li>10 gr salt</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Start the preparation of the baguette the <em>night before</em> with the pre-kneading: then put all the ingredients inside the mixer or Bimby or in a large bowl if kneading by hand, mix well (for the Bimby spike mode) for 5 minutes, then cover with foil and let rise in the oven off, or directly in the Bimby, overnight; you will notice small holes in the dough.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

</li>
</ul>
</figure>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The next day also add to the bowl all the ingredients of the &#8216;dough so malt, liquid sourdough, the flour and salt dissolved in warm water, and knead well (if you use the Bimby spiga mode) until the dough is smooth and homogeneous</p>

<p>Place them to rise supra the baking sheet lined with parchment paper, for about 2 more hours.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Before baking, make cross cuts on the surface of the baguettes, using a razor blade; in the meantime, turn on the static oven at 230°, place a pan with water in the bottom, which will be used to create steam while baking.</p>

<p>Brioches are very soft, fragrant and fluffy croissants made of leavened dough, made with sugar, eggs and butter, filled or plain, perfect to start the day in the best way. Also great the next day warmed slightly in the oven or microwave, you can fill the brioches with your favorite filling: jam, cream, chocolate, Nutella (I filled them with apple honey!), but they are also delicious plain, au naturel. Prepare this simple recipe for your breakfasts, or family snacks, and serve the croissants with a cup of coffee or milk: your day, and that of your children, will smile on you!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ingredients for 14 croissants:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
<li>150 g whole milk</li>
<li>one cube of fresh brewer&#8217;s yeast (or 8 g of the dry kind)</li>
<li>zest of half a lemon</li>
<li>250 gr of Manitoba flour</li>
<li>250 gr of 00 flour</li>
<li>70 gr of softened butter</li>
<li>pinch of salt</li>
<li>80 gr sugar</li>
<li>2 eggs</li>
<li>milk q.b. for brushing</li>
<li>honey to taste (or jam, Nutella or custard)</li>
<li>granulated sugar for decoration (optional)</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Start the preparation by dissolving the brewer&#8217;s yeast in warm milk, then cut the butter into small pieces and let it soften at room temperature.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the bowl of a planetary mixer, in the Bimby, or in a large bowl if kneading by hand), mix the flours, sugar, lemon zest and salt; add the yeast dissolved in the milk and start kneading. Then add the eggs and knead for 6 to 8 minutes on low speed (spiga mode for the Bimby); add the softened butter a small piece at a time, in several batches, and knead for another 5 minutes.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Transfer the resulting dough to a pastry board and knead it for a few seconds with your hands, forming a ball, then place it inside a lightly buttered bowl and let it rest, covering with clingfilm, in the oven for <strong>2 1/2 hours</strong>, with only the light on or until the dough doubles in volume.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Transfer the risen dough to a floured work surface and roll it out with a rolling pin, also &#8216;floured, to a thickness of 5 mm.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Using a pastry wheel or a sharp knife, form triangles of equal size, apply small cuts to the base, add the filling and roll the dough, always starting from the base of the triangle. I filled half of them with honey, half I left neutral.</p>

<p>At this point you can <em>freeze</em> your brioches, and then bake them at a later time: so leave them in the oven off overnight, and proceed with baking the next morning!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Brush again with milk, you can decorate with sugar sprinkles, and bake in a static oven preheated to 180° for 15 to 18 minutes.</p>
